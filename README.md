# Music Library

This Music Library project is a backend application, written in JavaScript, that manages information about music artists. 
It utilizes PostgreSQL as the backend database to store data such as artist names and genres. This library uses basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and also provides the ability to fetch all artists and search for artists by their unique IDs within the database.

## Features
* Create a new artist by sending a POST request.
* Delete an artist by sending a DELETE request.
* Update artist information using PUT and PATCH requests.
* Retrieve information about an artist using GET requests based on their ID.
* Fetch a table of all artists using a GET request.
